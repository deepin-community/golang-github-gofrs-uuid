Description: UUID library for Golang
 This library provides a pure Golang implementation of Universally Unique
 Identifiers (UUID) variant as defined in RFC-9562. This package supports
 both the creation and parsing of UUIDs in different formats.
 .
 The library supports the following UUID versions:
  * Version 1, based on timestamp and MAC address
  * Version 3, based on MD5 hashing of a named value
  * Version 4, based on random numbers
  * Version 5, based on SHA-1 hashing of a named value
  * Version 6, a k-sortable id based on timestamp, and field-compatible with v1
  * Version 7, a k-sortable id based on timestamp
